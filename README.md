Learning Java

Notes ~

Encapsulation

Binds together code and the data it manipulates (keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse)
An object is the device that supports encapsulation
Java’s basic unit of encapsulation is the class
Objects are instances of a class
What a Java programmer calls a method a C/C++ programmer calls a function

Polymorphism (greek for many forms)
“One interface, multiple methods”
P 36

Inheritance
Process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object
Food => fruits => apples
